# PhyML web interface project

This project is a web interface for the PhyML command line tool.

Two versions of the web interface were developped:
1. The first version was made localy by using a flask server by students at the DESS in bioinformatics at Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM) for class INF8214. To use this version see the ["flask" branch of the repo](https://github.com/nicdemon/phyml/tree/flask).
2. The second version was made by me using Streamlit and it is [hosted on their public cloud](). To use this version see the ["streamlit" branch of the repo](https://github.com/nicdemon/phyml/tree/streamlit).
